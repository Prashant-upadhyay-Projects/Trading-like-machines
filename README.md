# ðŸ“ˆ Trading Like a Machine â€“ Predictive Market Signals  

This project explores how **data science techniques can uncover trading opportunities** from stock market data. Using Python and Looker Studio, I built a pipeline to calculate technical indicators, detect buy/sell signals, and visualise them in an interactive dashboard.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights  
- **Data Source:** Daily stock prices (Kaggle World Stock Prices Dataset)  
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Moving Averages (MA-50, MA-200)  
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI-14)  
- **Signal Detection:**
  - Golden Cross (Buy) & Death Cross (Sell)  
  - *Strong Buy* logic = MA-50 > MA-200 **and** RSI < 30  
- **Visualisation:**
  - Python (Matplotlib)  
  - Interactive Looker Studio dashboard with:
    - Date range filters  
    - Buy/Sell overlays  
    - RSI thresholds (30/70)  
    - Strong Buy flags

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard (Work in Progress)  
Iâ€™m building a Looker Studio dashboard to make trading signals **stakeholder-ready**.  
ðŸ”— The live dashboard link will be shared here once published.
